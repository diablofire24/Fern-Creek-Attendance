# Fern-Creek-Attendance
A program to manage sign in of all employees in Fern Creek High School.
Uses python 3.4 and the included tkinter module.

Teachers will walk in and input their special code. Each teacher has a unique passcode that they will use to sign in.
The program will see if that code is correct and will assign that employee as "present" and print out thier name and 
time they arrived. After some time the administrator will put in a administrator code to print out the list of 
teachers who have not shown up.
